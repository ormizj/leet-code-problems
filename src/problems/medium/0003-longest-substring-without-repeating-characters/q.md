https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without duplicate characters.

**Example 1:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "abcabcbb"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that <code>"bca"</code> and <code>"cab"</code> are also correct answers.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "bbbbb"
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
</pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "pwwkew"
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
</pre>

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
